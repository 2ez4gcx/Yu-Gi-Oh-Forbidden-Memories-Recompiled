# More duelists than the disc has

The PC port can have opponents past the disc's thirty-nine. A mod adds them as
a file to a duelist in a `duelists/` folder, or as a `duelists` list in its
`mod.json`, and they work wherever a duelist does: the Free Duel grid, the
duel, the drop roll, the rank score, the save and a save state.

Each new duelist starts as a **copy** of a retail one, its *base*. Portrait,
deck pool, drop pools and AI come from that duelist; the name can be its own.
The disc has none of these duelists, so wherever the game goes to the disc, or
to a table the disc laid out, it asks for the base instead
(`Duelists_BaseId`) — the same shape [more cards](more-cards.md) uses for cards
past the disc's 722, and for the same reason.

What the base gives is then edited with the tables a mod already has
([gameplay tables](gameplay-tables.md)): `drops` and `decks` name an added
duelist as readily as a retail one, so a new opponent with a deck of its own is
a `duelists` entry and a `decks` entry for it.

This note is the whole of it: what a mod writes, and the design and disc
layouts underneath. What a mod writes comes first; [how it is
done](#how-it-is-done) is at the end.

A roster is a folder you drop characters into. There is no list to edit and no
code to compile: the manifest only switches the mod on, and everything else is
a file named after the duelist it belongs to.

```
shadow-duelists/
├── mod.json                     switches the mod on; nothing about duelists
├── duelists/dark-simon.json     who it is
├── decks/dark-simon.json        what it plays
├── drops/dark-simon.json        what you win from it
└── portraits/dark-simon.png     its face
```

**The filename is the id.** `duelists/dark-simon.json` makes a duelist whose id
is `dark-simon`, and the other three folders reach it by the same name. Nothing
inside the files repeats it.

**Anything missing falls back.** A duelist with no `decks/` file plays the deck
of the duelist it copies; with no `drops/` file it gives that duelist's cards;
with no portrait it wears that duelist's face. Only `duelists/<id>.json` is
required.

The same four folders are read from your own user directory as well, so a
character can be added without touching any mod. See [Your own
folder](#your-own-folder) at the end.

---

## Adding a duelist

One file:

**`duelists/dark-simon.json`**

```json
{
    "copy": "Simon Muran",
    "name": "Dark Simon"
}
```

That is a complete duelist. It appears on the Free Duel grid at the first free
place, playing Simon Muran's deck with his drops, face and way of playing, but
under its own name.

`copy` is the only required property. It names one of the disc's 39 opponents
(1 to 39) — by name, or by id. The copied duelist is called the **base**, and
it is where everything comes from that this duelist does not say for itself.

### Its own deck

**`decks/dark-simon.json`**

```json
{
    "replace": true,
    "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 200,
    "Mystical Elf": 100,
    "Baby Dragon": 100
}
```

Weights, not a card list: the game draws 40 cards from the pool, so a card with
twice the weight turns up about twice as often. See [the `decks/`
folder](#the-decks-folder) below — a deck pool needs at least **14** cards or
the edit is refused and the base's deck stands.

### Its own drops

**`drops/dark-simon.json`**

```json
{
    "pow": { "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 1, "Dark Magician": 1 },
    "bcd": { "Kuriboh": 3 },
    "tec": { "replace": true, "Raigeki": 1 }
}
```

Three pools, and which one you draw from depends on the rank you finish with:

| pool | also spelled | when you get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pow` | `sa-pow` | an S or A rank won on power |
| `bcd` | `b-c-d` | a B, C or D rank, either way |
| `tec` | `sa-tec` | an S or A rank won on technique |

You may give one pool, two or all three. A pool you leave out stays the base's.

### Its own face

**`portraits/dark-simon.png`** — any size, any proportions. The middle of it is
taken at the portrait's shape and reduced to the 48×48 of 64 colors the
console's slot holds, **and** the file itself is kept whole for the scaled
picture. So one file gives both: the portrait is as sharp as your image is at
View → Internal 2x and above, and correct at 1x.

---

## Replacing one of the disc's duelists

Use `replace` instead of `copy`, and the entry takes over that duelist rather
than making a new one:

**`duelists/heishin-remade.json`**

```json
{
    "replace": "Heishin",
    "name": "Heishin the Elder",
    "ai": { "copy": "Nitemare" }
}
```

Heishin keeps his place on the grid, his win and loss record and his campaign
appearances, but the grid and the duel now call him Heishin the Elder and he
plays like Nitemare.

- `decks/heishin-remade.json` and `drops/heishin-remade.json` change what he
  plays and gives — **named for your file's id, not for him.**
- `portraits/heishin-remade.png` gives him a new face.
- `slot` is meaningless on a replacement: he has his duelist's place already.
- An `unlock` on a replacement stands **in place of** his campaign flag, not
  beside it. That is how you make a duelist available from the start, or hold
  one back until something else has happened.
- The old name still works everywhere it is used to name him: another mod's
  `decks/Heishin.json` keeps finding him.

**Two mods replacing the same duelist:** the one that loads later has him. Two
mods asking for the same `slot` go the other way — the earlier keeps it and the
later takes the next free place, because moving a duelist that is already
placed would rearrange a roster its own mod laid out.

---

## The `duelists/` folder

One file to a duelist. **The filename is the id**: `dark-simon.json` makes a
duelist whose id is `dark-simon`, and `decks/`, `drops/` and `portraits/` reach
it by that same name. Nothing inside the file repeats it — an `"id"` property
here is ignored.

This is the only folder a duelist needs. The other three are all optional.

```json
{
    "copy": "Simon Muran",
    "name": "Dark Simon"
}
```

That is complete. It appears on the grid at the first free place, playing Simon
Muran's deck, giving his cards, wearing his face and playing his way — but
under its own name.

---

### How the folder is read

Only `*.json` is read. Anything else is ignored, which is what lets your save's
win and loss records (`<save code>.txt`) live in this same folder when it is the
user directory's.

Files are read **in the order their names sort**, not the order the folder
lists them. This matters: a duelist without a `slot` takes the lowest free
place, so read order decides where it lands. Sorting means a roster places
itself identically on every machine.

Each mod's folder is read in mod load order, and **the user directory's is read
last**, so a character you add yourself is placed after every mod's and never
pushes one of theirs aside.

---

### `copy` — building on one of the disc's

```json
{ "copy": "Heishin" }
```

Required, unless you use `replace`. It names one of the disc's 39 opponents,
**1 to 39**, by name or by id. That duelist is the **base**.

The base is where everything comes from that this file does not say: the deck,
the three drop pools, the portrait, and the nine numbers that decide how it
plays. It is also where the game reads the disc — an added duelist has no block
of its own on the disc, so every read goes to its base's.

Names ignore case and punctuation, so `heishin`, `Heishin` and `HEISHIN` are the
same. `Tables_DuelistNames` in `src/pc/cards/tables.c` is the list, spelled as
the game spells them.

### `replace` — taking over one of the disc's

```json
{ "replace": "Heishin", "name": "Heishin the Elder" }
```

Instead of adding a duelist, the entry takes over an existing one. It keeps its
place on the grid, its win and loss record and its campaign appearances, but
its name, face, way of playing and unlock become this file's.

- Use `replace` **or** `copy`, not both.
- `slot` is meaningless here: it has a place already.
- `decks/`, `drops/` and `portraits/` files for it are named after **this
  file's id**, not the duelist's. `duelists/heishin-remade.json` wants
  `decks/heishin-remade.json`.
- The duelist still answers to its original name everywhere else, so another
  mod's `decks/Heishin.json` keeps finding it.

**Two mods replacing the same duelist:** the one loading later has it.

A replacement that changes only one thing is a normal way to tweak a disc
duelist — this changes nothing but how duels against Nitemare are scored:

```json
{ "replace": "Nitemare", "ranks": { "turns": [[3, 12], [32767, -40]] } }
```

---

### `name`

What the Free Duel grid and the duel call it. Without one it uses its base's.

Only letters the game has can be shown; anything it cannot draw is left out and
noted in the Mods window.

### `slot` — where it sits on the grid

```json
{ "copy": "Heishin", "slot": 45 }
```

The id it wants, **40 to 127**, which *is* its place on the grid:

- page = `slot / 40`
- cell = `slot % 40`, filling five columns down and eight across

So 40 is the first cell of page 2, 45 is the sixth, and 80 starts page 3. The
last is 127, the eighth cell of page 4: ids stop below 128, where the game's
own opponent id turns negative.

Without a `slot` it takes the lowest free place. Slots are handed out once
every mod has been read, **explicit ones first**, so an entry that asked for a
place is never beaten to it by one that would have taken anything.

**Two entries wanting the same slot:** the earlier mod keeps it and the later
takes the next free place, and is told so. This is the opposite of how `replace`
resolves, deliberately — moving a duelist that is already placed would
rearrange a roster its own mod laid out, while a newcomer has asked for nothing
anyone depends on.

A slot nothing was placed in is not a duelist: its cell stays empty, exactly as
a locked one does. So `"slot": 90` makes three pages with most of the third
blank.

### `portrait`

A path to its picture, for when the file is not `portraits/<id>.png`:

```json
{ "copy": "Heishin", "portrait": "art/faces/mine.png" }
```

Relative to the mod, and it cannot reach outside it. You rarely want this — see
[the `portraits/` folder](#the-portraits-folder).

---

### `unlock` — when it appears

Every condition given must hold. Without `unlock` it is shown from the start.

```json
"unlock": {
    "beat": "Dark Simon",
    "wins": 2,
    "story": 1762,
    "card": "Blue-eyes White Dragon",
    "copies": 1
}
```

| condition | what it asks |
| --- | --- |
| `beat` | a duelist you must have beaten — by id, name or identity |
| `wins` | how many wins: against `beat` when there is one (**1** by default), otherwise against every duelist put together |
| `story` | a campaign story flag. `0x6E0 + n` is "duelist *n* is unlocked in Free Duel", so `1762` is Teana's |
| `card` | a card the trunk or deck must hold — by id or name |
| `copies` | how many of `card` (**1** by default) |
| `tower` | this run's [tower](tower-mode.md) (the last mod's that has one; with none on, it does not hold): `true` for it won to its top, or a floor, `1` up, won on this save |

**Only in the tower.** `"tower_only": true` on an added duelist keeps it off
the Free Duel grid until the [tower](tower-mode.md) lets it out: a won floor
fights it, or names it in its reward's `unlock_duelist`. Whatever else its
`unlock` says must hold too. The tower itself fights it all the same; a
stock duelist keeps its campaign (`tower_only` on a `replace` is noted and
left out).

```json
{ "id": "ghost", "copy": "Simon Muran", "name": "Ghost Simon", "tower_only": true }
```

**Nothing is stored.** Each condition is read from the save's own records,
trunk and flags (and its climb of the tower) every time the Free Duel screen
is built. So an unlock follows
whichever save is loaded, needs no file of its own, and a win in the duel you
just left opens up whatever it was the condition for — the screen is built
again on the way back.

A condition naming something that is not here — a duelist from a mod that is
switched off, a misspelt card — leaves the duelist **locked**, never open. A
roster does not open up by accident.

Chaining works: gate B behind A, and C behind B.

**On a replacement**, `unlock` stands *in place of* the campaign flag that
would normally decide, not beside it. That is how you make a disc duelist
available from the start, or hold one back.

---

### `ai` — how it plays

Nine numbers. Give them as a list, or as an object that borrows another
duelist's row and writes over part of it.

```json
"ai": { "copy": "Nitemare", "search": 20, "values": [20, 20, 10, 3, 2] }
```

| property | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `copy` | take the whole row from this duelist. It may be one another mod adds — rows are settled after every mod has been read |
| `search` | byte 0 on its own |
| `values` | a list, from byte 0. Shorter than nine is fine; the rest come from `copy`, or from the base |
| `sight` | whether it reads face-down cards — see below. Not a byte in the row |

That row reads: look 20 cards deep, change behaviour below 2000 life points
(byte 1 is the threshold ÷100), clamp the fusion search once 10 cards are left,
and fuse at depth 3 and 2. Bytes 5 to 8 are not listed, so they come from
Nitemare's row.

`values` is read after `search`, so when both write byte 0, `values` wins.

A plain list is the same as `values`:

```json
"ai": [20, 20, 10, 3, 2, 0, 0, 75, 25]
```

#### The nine bytes

**Byte 0 — deck search window, 5 to 20.** How many cards deep into its deck it
may look for something to play (a value past either end is held there, with
a note in the Mods window). This is the biggest difficulty dial there is:
Simon Muran and the villagers see **5** and are effectively playing off the top
of the deck, while Heishin sees **20** and finds his fusion material almost
every turn whatever he drew.

**Byte 1 — life-point threshold, stored ÷100.** Below this many life points it
changes how it plays. The retail rows use 1000, 2000 and 3000, and the byte
holds `10`, `20` and `30`; the script multiplies by 100 when it reads it. **So
write `20` for a 2000 threshold, not `2000`.**

**Byte 2 — remaining-deck threshold**, normally 5, 10 or 20. Once its deck is
down to this many cards the fusion search is clamped to depth 1 whatever byte 3
says: it stops attempting elaborate combos when it is close to decking out.

**Byte 3 — fusion depth for its first strategy, 1 to 3.** The search sets its
limit to this **plus one**, and that makes a sharp, easily missed cliff:

- a **field** card as the seed recurses from operand **1** upward
- a **hand** card as the seed only recurses at **3**

So operand 1 or 2 will combine a field monster with a hand card, but **never
starts a two-card fusion purely from the hand**. Only `3` does. Simon, Teana,
Villager 3, Mage Soldier and Seto 2nd sit at 1 — and byte 2's low-deck clamp
brings everyone there eventually. If you want a duelist that fuses out of hand,
byte 3 must be `3`; nothing else in the row substitutes for it.

**Byte 4 — the second strategy's depth, 1 to 3.** The script passes this
**minus one** to its evaluator, so it is offset from byte 3's meaning. Treat it
with some suspicion: the evaluator begins at depth 0 and can store a
one-addition improvement there, but reports success only when the depth is
nonzero, so not every improvement it finds is acted on. It is not a dependable
equip optimiser.

**Bytes 5 and 6 — read by nothing.** Neither retail script touches them. The
late bosses carry 4 and 5 here, which looks like a deeper search setting and is
not; the research note calls this out as a false lead.

**Byte 7 — duster and hold percentage**, 25, 50 or 75. How willing it is to use
field-clearing cards, and to hold a burn or heal card back for a better moment.

**Byte 8 — blind-attack percentage**, 0, 25, 50 or 75. How often it attacks a
face-down card it cannot identify. Jono and Rex Raptor are 75 and attack
recklessly. Pegasus is **0** — he never guesses, because he can see face-down
cards and has no need to.

##### `sight` — reading face-down cards

```json
"ai": { "copy": "Heishin", "sight": true }
```

Whether its searches may read a face-down card's identity and stats. `true`
sees them, `false` does not.

The disc decides this in the AI script's own bytecode, which tests the opponent
id against six duelists — Heishin, Pegasus, Heishin 2nd, Seto 3rd, DarkNite and
Nitemare — and hands the searches a flag. **Without `sight`, a duelist inherits
the answer for the duelist it `copy`s**, since the script is handed the base's
id. So a copy of Heishin already sees face-down cards; `sight` is only needed
to say otherwise, or to give it to a duelist whose base has none.

It is the one part of how a duelist plays that is not a number in the row, so
the array shorthand cannot express it — use the object form.

A replacement may set it for one of the disc's own:

```json
{ "replace": "Nitemare", "ai": { "sight": false } }
```

#### What the row still cannot set

**The strategy distributions** — the 70/15/15 sort of figures in the research
note's tables — are constants in the bytecode, not bytes in this row.

`notes/ai-hard-mode-research.md` §6 has the measured row of every duelist, and
the evidence behind each of these.

**Seeing face-down cards is not one of these.** It is written into the game's
own script for six duelists — Heishin, Pegasus, Heishin 2nd, Seto 3rd, DarkNite
and Nitemare. A duelist that **copies** one of them inherits it; no number here
can switch it on.

---

### `ranks` — how a duel against it is scored

```json
"ranks": {
    "turns":        [[3, 12], [6, 4], [12, 0], [20, -20], [32767, -40]],
    "remaining lp": [[100, -20], [2000, -10], [7000, 0], [8000, 8], [32767, 12]]
}
```

Each rule is up to five `[threshold, change]` pairs. After a duel, what you
managed on that rule walks the pairs until a threshold is above it, and that
pair's change lands on a score starting at 50. The total settles your S to D
letter — **and the letter decides which drop pool you roll**, so this changes
what a duelist is worth farming.

The ten rules, in the game's order:

`turns` · `effective attacks` · `defensive wins` · `face-down plays` ·
`pure magic` · `traps triggered` · `cards used` · `remaining lp` ·
`initiate fusion` · `equip magic`

A rule left out keeps the disc's. Fewer than five pairs is fine — the rest
repeat the last — and the final threshold ends the walk however the value
compares, as the disc's `32767` does.

This is per-duelist data the disc carries but never varies: all forty have a
byte-identical table. Reading the one above, a duel won by turn 3 is +12 but
one dragged past 20 turns is −40, which is far harsher than the disc's −12.

---

## The `decks/` folder

One file to a duelist, named for its id: `decks/dark-simon.json` gives a deck
to the duelist that `duelists/dark-simon.json` made.

**A duelist with no file here plays the deck of the duelist it copies.** That
is the whole fallback — you only write a file when you want something else.

```json
{
    "replace": true,
    "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 200,
    "Mystical Elf": 100,
    "Baby Dragon": 100
}
```

---

### It is a pool, not a deck list

The game does not store an opponent's forty cards. It stores a **weight for
every one of the 722 cards**, and deals a deck by drawing from them.

Dealing one card: pick a number from 1 to 2048, walk the card list adding up
weights, and take the card you land on. Repeat until forty cards are dealt,
skipping any card already dealt three times.

So a weight is a **share of 2048**, and what matters is the ratio between them:

```json
{ "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 1, "Mystical Elf": 3 }
```

is the same deck as

```json
{ "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 512, "Mystical Elf": 1536 }
```

Mystical Elf three times as often as Blue-Eyes, in both. Your numbers are
rescaled to add up to 2048 when the pool is built, so you never have to make
them add up yourself.

Because cards are drawn with repetition and capped at three copies, a heavy
card is nearly certain to appear three times, and a pool of fourteen equal
cards gives a fairly even spread of about three each.

---

### `replace`

**`"replace": true`** throws the base's pool away. Only the cards you list are
in the deck.

**Without it**, your cards take the share you give them and everything the base
had splits what is left over:

```json
{ "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 400 }
```

Blue-Eyes about a fifth of the deck (400 of 2048), the base's usual pool for
the other four fifths. This is the lighter touch — good for slipping one card
into an existing deck without rebuilding it.

If your listed weights already reach 2048 or more, the rest are dropped and
your cards are the pool in proportion, the same as `replace`.

---

### What is refused

Two mistakes leave the base's deck untouched and put a line in the Mods window:

**Fewer than 14 cards with weight.** A deck is 40 cards and at most 3 of each,
so 14 is the fewest a pool can fill one from. `{"replace": true, "Blue-eyes
White Dragon": 1}` cannot make a deck and is refused outright — this is the
single most common surprise.

**A pool that comes out empty**, for instance when every name in it is
misspelt.

Refusal is per pool, not per file. Everything else in the mod still loads.

---

### Card names

The game's own, from `notes/card-catalog.csv`. Case and punctuation are
ignored, so `blue-eyes white dragon` works — but the name must be the one
**Forbidden Memories** uses, which is not always the card's name today:

| write | not |
| --- | --- |
| `Winged Dragon #1` | Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1 |
| `Trial of Nightmares` | Trial of Nightmare |
| `Red-eyes B. Dragon` | Red-Eyes Black Dragon |

A card id works too: `"122": 100`.

A name that matches nothing is reported and left out; the rest of the pool
still applies. A card that is not in the game at all — Wall of Illusion, say —
has no id to give it, so there is nothing to write.

---

### Naming the file

Normally the id of your own `duelists/<id>.json`. But the name is also matched
against the duelists themselves, so you can reach one you did not add:

| filename | reaches |
| --- | --- |
| `dark-simon.json` | your `duelists/dark-simon.json` |
| `Heishin.json` | the disc's Heishin, whether or not a mod renamed it |
| `all.json` | **every** duelist at once |

`all.json` is applied to each of them in turn, so `{"Raigeki": 100}` without
`replace` slips Raigeki into everyone's deck.

Your own id is tried first, so a file named after a duelist you added always
means yours.

---

### Sorting and order

Files are read in the order their names sort, and each mod's folder in mod load
order, with the user directory's read **last**. Two edits to one duelist's deck
both apply, in that order, so the later one sits on top.

---

## The `drops/` folder

One file to a duelist, named for its id: `drops/dark-simon.json` decides what
the duelist that `duelists/dark-simon.json` made gives you for a win.

**A duelist with no file here gives the cards of the duelist it copies**, and a
pool you leave out of the file stays the base's. You only write what you want
to change.

```json
{
    "pow": { "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 1, "Dark Magician": 1 },
    "bcd": { "Kuriboh": 3 },
    "tec": { "replace": true, "Raigeki": 1 }
}
```

---

### The three pools, and which one you get

Every duelist carries three separate pools. Which you draw from is decided by
the **rank** you finish the duel with — not by the duelist, and not by chance:

| pool | also spelled | you draw from it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pow` | `sa-pow` | you finish **S or A**, and the rank was earned on power |
| `bcd` | `b-c-d` | you finish **B, C or D** — power or technique, it makes no difference |
| `tec` | `sa-tec` | you finish **S or A**, and the rank was earned on technique |

A duel is scored into a single number that starts at 50 (see `ranks` in
[the `duelists/` folder](#the-duelists-folder)). Below 50 the rank counts as
technique and the number is mirrored; the result picks a tier from D up to S.
Tiers below A always take `bcd`, so **the two good pools are only reachable
with an A or an S**.

That is why `ranks` and `drops` are worth thinking about together: making a
duelist easier to earn an S from makes its `pow` or `tec` pool reachable, and
making it harder locks players into `bcd`.

You may give one pool, two or all three.

---

### Weights

Exactly as decks work. A pool is a weight for each of the 722 cards, and
winning draws one card from it: pick a number from 1 to 2048, walk the list
adding weights, take the card you land on.

So a weight is a **share of 2048** and only the ratios matter —
`{"A": 1, "B": 3}` and `{"A": 512, "B": 1536}` are the same pool. Your numbers
are rescaled when the pool is built.

**`"replace": true`** throws the base's pool away and yours is the whole pool.
Without it, your cards take the share you name and the base's pool splits what
is left:

```json
{ "pow": { "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 200 } }
```

Blue-Eyes about a tenth of the time, the duelist's usual drops otherwise.

A pool that comes out empty is refused and the base's stands, with a line in
the Mods window. Unlike decks there is no minimum card count — a single-card
pool is a perfectly good drop table, and is the usual way to make a duelist
farmable for one card:

```json
{ "tec": { "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 1 } }
```

That means an S or A on technique always gives Blue-Eyes.

---

### Card names

The game's own, from `notes/card-catalog.csv`. Case and punctuation ignored,
but the name must be the one Forbidden Memories uses — `Winged Dragon #1`, not
"Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1"; `Trial of Nightmares`, plural. An
id works too. A name matching nothing is reported and left out.

---

### Naming the file

Normally the id of your own `duelists/<id>.json`, but the name is matched
against the duelists themselves too:

| filename | reaches |
| --- | --- |
| `dark-simon.json` | your `duelists/dark-simon.json` |
| `Simon Muran.json` | the disc's Simon Muran — spaces in filenames are fine |
| `all.json` | **every** duelist at once |

Editing a disc duelist's drops needs no `duelists/` file at all: a file named
after it here is enough.

`all.json` is applied to each duelist in turn, so this makes every opponent in
the game capable of dropping one card without disturbing anything else:

```json
{ "tec": { "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 100 } }
```

---

### Sorting and order

Files are read in the order their names sort, each mod's folder in mod load
order, and the user directory's **last**. Two edits to one pool both apply in
that order, the later on top — so `all.json` followed by a named file lets you
set a baseline and then override one duelist.

---

## The `portraits/` folder

One image to a duelist, named for its id: `portraits/dark-simon.png` gives a
face to the duelist that `duelists/dark-simon.json` made.

**A duelist with no image here wears the face of the duelist it copies.**

PNG only, and **any size or shape you like**. There is nothing to configure.

---

### One file, two pictures

The Free Duel grid's slot is tiny: 48×48 pixels, 8 bits a pixel, through a
64-entry palette. That is what the console had and what the game still uploads.

Your PNG becomes both of these:

1. **The console's portrait.** Centre-cropped to a square, box-averaged down to
   48×48, and reduced to a palette of 64 colors. It is what the grid's cell
   genuinely contains, and what the game draws when your picture is 48×48 or
   smaller.
2. **The picture itself, kept whole.** A picture bigger than 48×48 is
   registered the way a texture pack's image is, and a pack's image stands in
   for the cell's texels at every scale: at View → Internal 1x its middle
   square averaged down to 48×48 in the console's 15-bit color (not reduced
   to 64), and at Internal 2x and above drawn at its own resolution.

So a portrait is as sharp as the file you give it, with no second image and no
"hd" folder. Give it one good picture. The FM Editor's Duelists tab shows each
of these as the game draws it, and `tests/pc/editor_duelists_runtime.py`
holds its 1x picture to the game's frames pixel for pixel.

#### What to give it

- **Square** is easiest, since a non-square image is cropped to its centre
  square first — the sides of a wide picture are simply thrown away. Crop it
  yourself if the framing matters.
- **Large is fine.** 512×512 or more is drawn at its own size when the internal
  resolution is high enough.
- Transparency is not kept: the portrait slot has no alpha.
- A picture of 48×48 or less is shown in its 64 colors: strong, flat color
  survives that reduction better than a soft gradient, which can band. A
  bigger picture is unaffected.

---

### How the sharp one reaches the screen

Worth knowing, because it explains a limitation elsewhere.

The texture pack matches images by **where their pixels came from on the
disc**: every VRAM word carries a tag saying which disc byte it was read from,
and a pack image is keyed to that. A picture built in memory has no such tag,
which is exactly why an added duelist does *not* wear a texture pack's HD
picture of whoever it copies — there is nothing to match.

A mod's portrait is given a tag of its own, in a range above every real disc
offset, and registered with the pack at that same place. The image and its
palette are tagged separately, because the pack matches a palette by the tag on
the palette's own first word. From there nothing else knows the difference: the
same machinery that draws an HD picture of a disc texture draws yours.

You do not need a `textures` pack in your mod for this. One picture needs no
pack at all.

---

### Naming the file

The duelist's id, which is the name of its `duelists/` file:

| `duelists/` file | portrait |
| --- | --- |
| `dark-simon.json` | `dark-simon.png` |
| `Yugi.json` | `Yugi.png` — capitals must match |
| `heishin-remade.json` (a replacement) | `heishin-remade.png` |

A replacement is named after **your** file's id, not after the duelist it takes
over: `duelists/heishin-remade.json` replacing Heishin wants
`portraits/heishin-remade.png`.

If a file cannot be named this way, point at it from the duelist instead:

```json
{ "copy": "Heishin", "portrait": "art/faces/mine.png" }
```

The path is relative to the mod and cannot reach outside it.

Unlike the other three folders, nothing here is scanned — a portrait is looked
for by name when its duelist is read. An unused image costs nothing, and this
README is ignored.

---

### Replacing a disc duelist's face

Give the replacement entry a portrait like any other:

```
duelists/heishin-remade.json    { "replace": "Heishin", ... }
portraits/heishin-remade.png
```

The disc's own duelists keep their faces unless a mod replaces them, and a
texture pack's HD portraits still apply to those, since theirs *do* come from
the disc.

---

## `bust` — the large character

The portrait is the small face on the Free Duel grid. The **bust** is the large
character the campaign's dialogue stands on its stone-framed box, the one a
[tower](tower-mode.md#story)'s stories bring in. A duelist's entry may give it
one of its own, with **named expressions** that talk and blink as the disc's
do (mod API 17, [Which game a mod needs](modding.md#which-game-a-mod-needs)):

```json
{
    "id": "ghost",
    "copy": "Simon Muran",
    "name": "Ghost Simon",
    "bust": {
        "default": "calm",
        "expressions": [
            {
                "name": "calm",
                "image": "busts/ghost/calm.png",
                "talk": ["busts/ghost/calm-talk1.png", "busts/ghost/calm-talk2.png"],
                "blink": "busts/ghost/calm-blink.png"
            },
            { "name": "angry", "image": "busts/ghost/angry.png", "talk": "busts/ghost/angry-talk1.png" },
            { "name": "sad", "image": "busts/ghost/sad.png" }
        ]
    }
}
```

`"bust": "busts/ghost.png"` is the short form: one expression, named
`default`, that neither speaks nor blinks.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | the expression a story shows when it names none; required (without it, or naming none of them, the first is taken, noted) |
| `expressions` | the list, at most 16, each with a `name` (up to 31 bytes; two may not share one, whatever their case) and an `image` |
| `image` | the expression's picture: a PNG with clear parts, a path inside the mod |
| `talk` | a PNG, or a list of up to 4: the frames the mouth moves through while the words are typed |
| `blink` | a PNG: the eyes shut, shown for a moment at the game's random times |

**The pictures.** Every picture of a bust is the default expression's size
(another size is stretched to it, noted), and a picture larger than 256 x 256
is shrunk to fit, keeping its shape. It stands on the box as the campaign's
characters do: its middle over the side's place, its bottom just under the
box's top, or, taller than the 178 rows above it, its top at the screen's and
the rest under the box. It is drawn at the console's resolution. All the
pictures of a bust share one palette of 255 colors.

**Talking and blinking** are the game's own (`DisplayEffect_UpdateMenuRecord`):
the speaker's mouth takes the shape its letters ask for, and a speaker's eyes
close now and then. A talking frame and a blink frame are drawn **over** the
expression's picture where they differ from it, as the disc's mouths and eyes
are parts drawn over a body: so draw them as the same picture with the mouth
open, or the eyes shut. A frame can change and add pixels, not clear them. An
expression without `talk` keeps its mouth still; without `blink` it never
blinks; a frame the same as its picture is no frame. Nothing missing is ever a
blank or a crash: the picture alone is what is left.

**The expressions' numbers.** The game's codes number a character's
expressions 0 to 3. A bust's are, in order: the **default** first, then the
others **in the list's order** (above: calm 0, angry 1, sad 2). A story may name
an expression by its name or by that number.

**How many change in place.** The game changes a character's face in place
(`F6 id 4e`) among four expressions of one record: one sheet of 256 x 256 texels
and 2 KB of parts. The first expression of a record is its picture whole; the
others are that picture where they are the same and their own parts where they
differ, cut in squares from 128 texels down to 8; a talking or blink frame is
the squares where it differs from its expression. So a bust whose expressions
share a body and change their faces keeps four to a record easily (the tests'
128 x 192 figure: three expressions with two talking frames and a blink each fit
one record). What does not fit, and a fifth expression on, goes in the bust's
next record: changing to it brings it in as another character -- the old one
slides out and the new one in. An expression too big to fit a record even alone
is made without its blink, then with fewer talking frames (noted). The mods'
busts have 127 records in all.

### A disc duelist's bust

A [replacement](#replacing-one-of-the-discs-duelists) entry may give one of the
disc's duelists a bust:

```json
{ "replace": "Seto", "bust": { "default": "smug", "expressions": [ ... ] } }
```

That changes nothing in Free Duel (its name, face and play stay the disc's
unless the entry says otherwise). By default it **adds** expressions: a story
naming Seto, or Seto with a number, still shows the campaign's own character;
only a story naming one of the bust's expressions by name shows the bust. The
campaign is untouched.

**`"replace_bust": true`** makes the bust the duelist's character **in the
campaign too**. Off by default, because it changes the campaign:

- the campaign character the duelist is (the table below) is drawn from the
  bust in **every** scene that shows it -- every scene of the story, not only
  that duelist's duels. A character several duelists share is the bust's for
  all of them: replacing Seto's is Seto 2nd's and Seto 3rd's too (all three are
  character 4), Teana's is Teana 2nd's, Jono's Jono 2nd's, Heishin's Heishin
  2nd's;
- the campaign's expression *n* (0-3) of that character is the bust's
  expression *n* (the default, then the list's order); one the bust lacks, or
  one past its first record, is its default;
- talking and blinking are the bust's frames; the scenes themselves -- the
  words, the box, the small portraits beside it, the backgrounds, the music,
  what happens -- are the campaign's;
- a tower's stories show the bust wherever they show that character, and
  naming the duelist with no expression is the bust's default;
- two duelists replacing the same character (Seto and Seto 3rd, say, from two
  mods): the later mod in the load order has it, whichever duelist's id is
  the higher -- within one mod, the later entry -- as with any other
  replacement; the Mods window tells both mods which bust the campaign shows.

Without `replace_bust` the campaign is the game's frame for frame (the
end-to-end test compares the campaign's first scene with a master build's and
with the same mod's without the bust). The villagers and the five shrine mages
are no character in the campaign, so `replace_bust` changes nothing for them
(noted). The campaign's other characters (the prince, 0x0C, and those that are
nobody's duelist) are no duelist's to replace.

### Which character a disc duelist is

The large character the campaign brings in before each duelist's duel (the
last `F6 01-40` of the text that starts it, `F8 0D <duelist>`; Jono's duels
show none there, and he is 0x02 where he speaks; `tower_config.c`,
`Tower_DuelistCharacter`). This is what a duelist shows on a tower's stage
today, and what `replace_bust` replaces. An added duelist without a bust of
its own is its base's.

| # | duelist | character |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Simon Muran | 0x01 |
| 2 | Teana | 0x03 |
| 3 | Jono | 0x02 |
| 4-6 | Villager 1-3 | none |
| 7 | Seto | 0x04 |
| 8 | Heishin | 0x07 |

| 15 | Pegasus | 0x15 |
| 16 | Isis | 0x2F |
| 17 | Kaiba | 0x0E |
| 18 | Mage Soldier | 0x18 |
| 19 | Jono 2nd | 0x02 |
| 20 | Teana 2nd | 0x03 |
| 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 | Ocean, Forest, Mountain, Desert, Meadow Mage | none |

### On a tower's stage

`{"duelist": "ghost", "expression": "angry"}` on a side of a story
([Story](tower-mode.md#story)): the duelist's bust in that expression. A later
line naming another expression of the same record changes the face in place.
An added duelist with a bust is its bust wherever a story shows it, `"opponent"`
included; a disc duelist only with `replace_bust`, or when a name of its bust's
is asked for.

### How a bust is made

`src/pc/free_duel/busts.c`, once every mod is read (`Busts_Make`, from
`Duelists_Build`): all of a bust's pictures through one palette
(`CardArt_IndexedImages`), then into records of the disc's kind -- what
`func_8003A560` keeps in a cache slot for a character it read from WA sector
15182 + id x 50: a 384 x 256 sheet at 8 bits (the parts in its first 256
columns, one texture page, as the disc's characters have them), two rows of 256
colors (the second semi-transparent) and a 0x800-byte parts bank
(`DisplayEffect_BuildResourceObjects`): per expression a body (variant 0
held), eyes (variant 0 held with nothing over the body, variant 1 the blink's
parts for eight frames, then a stop, which `DisplayEffect_UpdateMenuRecord`
waits for to open them again) and a mouth (variants 0-7 for the glyph's kind:
0 and 4-7 closed, 1 and 2 the first two talking frames held, 3 played through
them and closed again). Each frame's parts have the disc's ten-bit offsets
(flag 0x10). An expression without eyes or mouth has no such piece, as Simon
Muran has no mouth on the disc. The four expression slots a record has are
never empty: one it does not hold is its first's.

A record is given to the game where a character's cache slot is filled
(`Tower_FillCharacter`, `zz_tower_storage.c`, asked by `func_8003A560` before
it reads the disc, `#ifdef MEMORIES_PC`): for a `replace_bust` character
always, for a story's bust through the characters the disc keeps empty (0x27,
0x28, 0x29, 0x0B, 0x05, the tower's pool). Without a replacing bust and a story
on the screen it does nothing, and the disc is read as always.

## The manifest instead of the folders

A roster need not be in folders at all. Each of `duelists`, `decks` and `drops`
may be written out in the manifest, or be the name of a file of the mod's
holding exactly what the key would have held:

```json
{
    "id": "shadow-duelists",
    "duelists": "tables/duelists.json",
    "decks": "tables/decks.json",
    "drops": "tables/drops.json"
}
```

Written out, the same thing is:

```json
{
    "id": "shadow-duelists",
    "name": "Shadow Duelists",
    "duelists": [
        { "id": "dark-simon", "copy": "Heishin", "name": "Dark Simon" }
    ],
    "decks": {
        "dark-simon": { "replace": true, "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 200 }
    },
    "drops": {
        "dark-simon": { "tec": { "Blue-eyes White Dragon": 40 } }
    }
}
```

An entry written out carries its own `"id"`, which the folders take from the
filename; everything else is the same property by the same name. Both ways work
together and a mod may use either: a manifest's `"duelists"` list, a file it
names, and a folder of files are all read.

A duelist is named — in `drops`, `decks` and anywhere else — by its id, its
name, or its `"<mod-id>:<id>"` identity. Saves use those identities; an entry
written out with no `"id"` is identified by its place in the list, which moves
when the list is edited.

---

## `mod.json`

Only what makes it a mod:

```json
{
    "id": "shadow-duelists",
    "name": "Shadow Duelists",
    "enabled": true,
    "min_api": 4,
    "game": "slus_01411"
}
```

`enabled` is only the default — the Mods window switches it either way.


---

## Your own folder

The same four folders are read from your user directory, so you can add a
character without touching a mod:

| system | where |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/YFM Re-Decomp/` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/YFM Re-Decomp/`) |
| Windows | `Documents\My Games\YFM Re-Decomp\` |

`MEMORIES_USER_DIR` overrides it if you would rather keep it somewhere else.

Put `duelists/`, `decks/`, `drops/` and `portraits/` there and they work
exactly as a mod's do. They are read **last**, so a character you add is placed
after every mod's and never moves one of theirs.

Your win and loss records live in that same `duelists/` folder, named by the
save and ending `.txt`. Only `*.json` is read as a duelist, so the two sit side
by side without trouble.

---

## When something is wrong

The Mods window lists what could not be read: a card name that names nothing, a
duelist a condition points at that is not here, a slot already taken, a file
that is not valid JSON. Nothing is guessed at — an entry that cannot be
understood is left out and the rest still load.

Files are read **in the order their names sort**, not the order the folder
happens to list them, so a roster places itself the same way on every machine.
---

## The mod API

`duelist_id` sits beside `card_id` in the host (`modapi.h`, API 5):

```c
int id = host->duelist_id(host, "shadow-duelists:dark-simon");
```

An added duelist's id depends on which mods are applied, in what order, and
what slots they asked for, so a code mod cannot write it down in advance. It
resolves an identity to the id this run, and answers 0 for a duelist that is
not here -- and for one of the disc's own, whose id already names it.

`Duelists_Find` is the resolver, handed to the mod layer at the end of
`Duelists_Build` the way `cards.c` hands over `Cards_FindIdentity`, so
`mods.c` needs to know nothing about duelists. It answers -1 for a duelist it
does not have and the host reports that as 0, which is what `card_id` promises
for a card.

Raising the API to 5 costs applied mods nothing: the check refuses a mod built
for an API *newer* than the host's, so everything declaring 4 still loads.

---

## How it is done

`src/pc/free_duel/duelists.c` holds the list, and the table layer spans it:
`Tables_PoolFor`, `duelist_named` and `"all"` all work over
`Duelists_Count()`, and the per-duelist edit marks grow with it.
`PoolEdit.duelist` is an int, which it has to be once a mod can take the list
past what a byte holds.

Ids stop at 128. `gDuel_bOpponentID` is a signed byte, so an id of 128 or over
reads back negative — `Duel_InitScene` would take that for a two-player duel,
the results screen for no opponent, and every table lookup would miss.

### The records

The win/loss record has a slot: `Duelists_RecordSlot(state, duelist)` gives
the save block's own two halfwords for the first forty and this module's
storage past them, so a reader does not care which it has. The Free Duel
screen reads and writes through it. Storage is
`src/pc/game/free_duel_storage.c`, a game unit like `card_storage.c` and
`drops.c` — so a save state carries it, and it sorts after both so that no
existing variable moves.

Nothing the disc laid out is moved: `gFreeDuel_abGridAvailable` stays in the
overlay's `module_state.c` and the records stay at `0x51C`, pinned by their
static assert. What an added duelist needs sits beside them, as
`Cards_ChestSlot` does for cards past the disc's 722.

Those records outlive a save state too. `duelists/<code>.txt` in the user
directory keeps them by identity, in sections by save sequence, written when
the game writes a save and read when it loads one — beside the memory card's
block, as the added cards' trunk is. A save made while no duelist mod was
applied has no section of its own and reads the newest earlier one. A record
whose duelist is not in this run is dropped rather than guessed at, since its
id would belong to somebody else. Ordinary play never makes the file.

NEW GAME writes a new duelist code into the running save without loading one,
so `Duelists_Frame` watches that code and clears the added records when it
changes, as `Cards_Frame` does the trunk.

A line of the file is `record <wins> <losses> <identity>`, the identity last
because it may hold spaces: `duelists/Dark Simon.json` is `<mod>:Dark Simon`.

A roster in folders is read once at startup like a manifest's keys are, so a
mod carrying only folders asks for a restart the same way — it has no key that
would otherwise say so.

### Pages

The grid holds forty cells whatever the roster is, and shows a page of forty
duelists in them. Page 0 is the disc's own — Deck Build and the thirty-nine
opponents; a page past it shows what a mod added. `cell_duelist(cell)` turns
the cursor's cell into the duelist it stands for, and everything that means a
duelist goes through it: the win/loss record, whether the grid shows the cell,
and the opponent the duel starts with. The arithmetic is `Duelists_AtCell`, in
the list rather than in the screen, because the port's own screens draw over
the grid too and must reach the same answer — View > Free Duel progress counts
the duelist under the cursor, not the cell.

Pages rather than a taller grid because only one page's portraits need to be
in video memory at a time. The screen's palette strip holds 48 CLUTs, which
would otherwise cap the whole roster there.

Deck Build is duelist 0, so it is the top left of the first page only; on a
later page that cell is somebody to duel.

**L1 and R1 turn the page.** The screen reads only the pad's directions,
Cancel and Confirm, so the shoulder buttons were free, and they already mean
"by a page" on the Library's grid.

`FreeDuel_ShowPage` does the turning, and it allocates nothing. A cell's
texture slot and palette are fixed by the cell, so the forty sprites
`FreeDuel_Init` builds stand for whatever is put in those slots: a page
changes only the texels in them, and a cell the page does not fill has
`DISPLAY_OBJECT_FLAG_RENDERABLE` cleared rather than being released. That is
what makes a page cost nothing in video memory over the grid the disc already
had. Init builds all forty now, shown or not, since a cell with no sprite
could not be made to appear later.

The name and the win/loss box are only rebuilt when the cursor arrives
somewhere, so a page turn asks `FreeDuel_PlaceCursor` for that itself.

A locked duelist is an empty cell, exactly as a locked retail one is. Pages are
counted from how many duelists there are and not from how many are unlocked, so
a duelist keeps its place on the grid as the conditions around it are met.

### The page indicator

A page indicator says which page the grid shows and how to turn it. It is the
game's own text box with the game's own letters, composed in the text codes as
`cards/drops.c` composes the results screen's added pages, and answered for one
reserved id that `Text_Resolve` asks about. So it reads as part of the screen
and scales with the picture rather than being drawn over the top of it. It sits
along the top of the picture, above the FREE DUEL artwork: the button to go
back at the left, "PAGE n/m" centred, the button to go on at the right, and
beside each button the game's own red arrow — the sprite the card viewer puts
at the foot of its page and the hand's card cycling puts either side of a card
(texture `0x20C`, the operand before the color choosing which way it faces).
A single page says nothing at all.

All three runs are one string in one box on channel 2. Channel 3 is Build
Deck's and the Library's, and a box either left there is what this screen would
find; the screen's own boxes are 0 (the duelist's name) and 1 (the "no deck"
message), which leaves 2.

The words in the middle are the port's own string `TEXT_OWN_FREE_DUEL_PAGE`
(`FE11`, `pc/text/text.h`), so a translation writes them as it writes the
results screen's `PAGE %d OF %d`: letters and spaces, with `%d` where each
number goes, and the English when a translation gives anything else. "L1" and
"R1" are the buttons' own names and stay as they are.

**The size command decides whether a box is drawn from the font.** `0xF8 0x04`
is the cell size, not the color — the color is `0x0A`. Size 1 is the 8x8
sheet the card counts are drawn in and it sets `flags_34`'s `0x100`, after
which `DuelEffect_AppendEntry` stamps every entry `flags_11 = 0xC0` and
`func_80035E20` draws them through `sprites[2]` from that sheet. Those entries
never reach the glyph code, so they never take HD text's mark and the box
cannot be set in a font however the rest of it is configured; the build also
overwrites the channel's `field_5A`/`field_5B` with the sheet's 8x8. Size 2 is
the letters, which is what this line asks for.

### The name as a string id

The name is the shape `Cards_Text` has: `Duelists_Text(id, text)` answers for
the string a duelist is named by, and is hung off the same two calls in
`text_lookup_string.c` and `text_box_build_step.c`. The name is stored in the
game's own glyph codes, made the way `cards.c` makes a card's, so a letter the
game does not have is reported rather than drawn as rubbish.

Which id that is depends on the duelist, and `Duelists_NameTextId` is the one
place that decides:

- **One of the disc's own, replaced or not**, keeps the disc's id, `0x8328 +
  id`. That is what the screen and the duel have always asked for, and
  answering there is what makes a replacement's new name the one both show.
- **An added duelist** gets a private id, `0xFF00` upwards, one each. The
  disc's range stops at duelist 39: `0x8350` onwards are the campaign's
  location names, so naming an added duelist that way renamed Metropolis
  everywhere. The private range sits clear of the disc's strings, of the port's
  own block (`TEXT_OWN_FIRST` to `TEXT_OWN_LAST`) and of the composed ids
  handed out from `0xFFFF` down; `text.h` carries the whole map.

Nothing on the disc answers a private id, so an added duelist with no `"name"`
is given its base's rather than whatever that id happens to read.

Going the other way — a name in a manifest to the duelist it reaches — is
`Duelists_Named`, and the rule tables ask it rather than keeping their own
idea: a stock duelist a mod renamed still answers to the name the disc gave it,
so another mod's `decks` keeps naming it, and a slot nothing was placed in
answers to nothing.

### The disc's own rank rows

Each duelist's disc block is three sectors, 6,144 bytes:

| offset | size | what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1,460 | the deck pool (`gDuel_awOpponentDeckPool`) |
| 1,460 | 1,460 | S/A-POW drops (`gDuel_awSaPowCardDrops[0]`) |
| 2,920 | 1,460 | B/C/D drops |
| 4,380 | 1,460 | S/A-TEC drops |
| 5,840 | 304 | the rank score's rules (`gDuel_awRankScoreChange`) |

The last 304 bytes are ten rules of five threshold/change pairs, 200 bytes
used and the rest `0xFF`. After a duel each measured value walks its rule
until a threshold exceeds it and the change lands on a score that starts at
50; the total settles the S to D letter, and through `rank_tier` and
`is_tec_rank` it picks which drop pool is rolled.

**It is per duelist and the disc never varies it.** Every one of the forty
carries a byte-identical copy — read them off the image and they hash the same
— so `ranks` is a hook the game left unused rather than a dimension it plays
with. The rows are read with the duelist and handed to the tables once it has
an id (`Tables_SetRank`), since a duelist's place is not settled until every
mod has been read.

What the disc gives every duelist, for comparison:

| rule | the disc's row |
| --- | --- |
| turns | `<5:+12 <9:+8 <29:0 <33:-8 else -12` |
| effective attacks | `<2:+4 <4:+2 <10:0 <20:-2 else -4` |
| defensive wins | `<2:0 <6:-10 <10:-20 <15:-30 else -40` |
| face-down plays | `<1:0 <11:-2 <21:-4 <31:-6 else -8` |
| pure magic | `<1:+2 <4:-4 <7:-8 <10:-12 else -16` |
| traps triggered | `<1:+2 <3:-8 <5:-16 <7:-24 else -32` |
| cards used | `<9:+15 <13:+12 <33:0 <37:-5 else -7` |
| remaining lp | `<100:-7 <1000:-5 <7000:0 <8000:+4 else +6` |
| initiate fusion | `<1:+4 <5:0 <10:-4 <15:-8 else -12` |
| equip magic | `<1:+4 <5:0 <10:-4 <15:-8 else -12` |

### One PNG, two pictures

A duelist's face becomes a whole portrait record through
`CardArt_PortraitFromImage`, beside the card art converters and using the same
resampling and palette reduction, which `FreeDuel_ShowPage` uploads in the
base's place.

The full-size half is registered the way an added card's picture is
(`cards.c`, `add_full_picture`): `TexturePack_AddMade` is given the record's
image and palette bytes and the PNG, and the pack knows the grid's upload by
those bytes (`recall`), since a record built in memory has no disc offset to
be tagged with. A PNG at 48x48 or under has nothing more to show and is not
registered. Made images are kept across a pack's loads and unloads, so a mod
carrying one picture needs no pack at all.

A duelist with no picture of its own uploads its base's record and gets the
pack's picture of the base, which is what it should get.

### Where `sight` goes, and why

The disc settles face-down sight in the AI script's own bytecode, which tests
the opponent id against six duelists — Heishin (8), Pegasus (15), Heishin 2nd
(35), Seto 3rd (36), DarkNite (37) and Nitemare (38) — and hands the searches a
register saying whether to pass a face-down card over. Since
`AiScript_LoadOpponentID` gives the script the **base's** id, a duelist a mod
added already inherits the answer for the duelist it copies.

Four searches read that register, and the override goes at each of them rather
than at the id, because the id is what the bytecode compares and only the
bytecode knows which register it put the answer in:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `AiScript_FindDefenseStopper` | `ai_script_find_card.c` |
| `AiScript_FindBestAttack` | `ai_script_find_best_attack.c` |
| two combo searches | `ai_script_combo.c` |

All four use the same sense — 0 reads face-down cards, non-zero passes them
over — and `Duelists_HidesFaceDown` returns what the script asked for when the
duelist says nothing, so an unmodified roster behaves exactly as before.

Substituting a different id in `AiScript_LoadOpponentID` would have been
smaller, and was rejected: the register the bytecode derives is not the only
thing it does with that id, and without a disassembler there is no way to know
what else would move.

That the script is handed the base's id has one consequence worth naming:
`AiScript_LoadOpponentData` is asked about the base, not about the duelist, so
when the id it is asked about is this duel's own opponent it asks
`Duelists_AiRow` for the opponent instead. Otherwise a duelist's own `"ai"`
would reach nothing but byte 0.

## Limits

* Ids 1 to 127: the disc's 39 and 88 added, on pages 0 to 3.
* A duelist is a copy of one of the disc's: its model of play, its script and
  where the disc is read are its base's.
* The strategy distributions in the bytecode are not reachable from `"ai"`.
* A bust: 16 expressions, 4 talking frames each, pictures of 256 x 256 at
  most, 4 expressions changed in place a record, 127 records for all the
  mods' busts; a talking or blink frame draws over its expression, it cannot
  clear what is there.

## Checking it

`duelists.c`, `free_duel_storage.c`, `tables.c` and `cards.c` compile clean
under `-Wall -Wextra`, and `screen_runtime.c` under the build's own flags. The
retail path is untouched: its preprocessor sees no reference to any of this.

What the rest of the port does with a roster it cannot see is covered too.
`pc_tables`, `pc_free_duel_progress`, `pc_card_drops` and `pc_rank` link units
this touches, and share `tests/pc/duelists_stubs.c`: the list as a run with no
duelist mod, the disc's forty, which is what their cases are written against.
`pc_fm_editor_roster` reads a mod's own roster as duelists to edit and writes it back
in these folders (`fm_editor/tests/test_roster.py`), and keeps a `decks` or
`drops` entry naming another mod's duelist, or either table named as a file,
exactly as the mod wrote it. `tests/pc/editor_duelists_runtime.py` plays a
roster the FM Editor made: the pages, the portraits against the game's frames,
a duel's deck and its drop.

`tests/pc/duelists_test.c` (`ctest -R pc_duelists`) covers what is settled
without a screen: slots and their collisions, replacement precedence, the AI
row's layering, face-down sight, every unlock condition, the rank rules, the
folder reader, the mod API's resolver, which string id names a duelist, what a
name in a manifest reaches, a record round-tripped through the sidecar by an
identity with a space in it, NEW GAME clearing the added records, and which
entry keeps a `bust` and a `replace_bust`. It runs real manifests through the real
JSON reader, and is checked by mutation — better than twenty deliberate
breaks, each of which fails it.

`tests/pc/busts_test.c` (`ctest -R pc_busts`) reads `bust` right and wrong
(every note it can raise) and reads the records it is made into back the way
the game reads a character's parts bank: every expression's body drawn from
the sheet is its picture texel for texel, its blink and talking frames drawn
over it are those pictures, the variants the game may ask for are all there
and stop where they must, an expression without frames has no eyes or mouth,
a picture too big for a record with another goes on in the next, and a disc
duelist's `replace_bust` takes over its character (the later of two in load
order having it, both orders tried). `tests/pc/tower/busts_e2e.py` plays it in the game: a mod's duelist with
three expressions talking, blinking and changing face in place in a tower
story, the old forms beside it, and the campaign's first scene with Simon
Muran's bust kept (frames hashed against a master build and the same mod's
without the bust) and replaced.
