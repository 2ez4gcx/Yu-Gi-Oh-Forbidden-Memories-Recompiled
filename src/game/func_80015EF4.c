/* Draws one 3D duel card. The display object's Euler bytes and position build
 * a local matrix in the scratchpad, four card corners are rotated, lit with
 * RotColorDpq into the POLY_GT4 and sorted at their mean depth, and the same
 * corners flattened to y = 0 are projected with RTPS into the POLY_FT4 that
 * is sorted at the back as the card's ground sprite.
 *
 * What the retail listing fixes about the source:
 * - The scale test reads the 16-bit flags word against GsROTOFF (1 << 27).
 *   cse cannot see that the mask misses every bit of a halfword; combine can,
 *   but only after the test is its own instruction, so retail keeps a literal
 *   zero, a branch that never goes, and the dead temporary's stack slot.
 * - The matrix, the first corner, the scale, the light normal, the rotation
 *   and the depth words are pointers set once after the guard, in address
 *   order. Corners 1-3 and copies 1-3 get their own pointers where they are
 *   first used; copy 0 is rot[4].
 * - Each chained store writes the right-hand corner first.
 * - The RTPS inputs are literal scratchpad addresses, which reload
 *   materialises in $t0-$t3.
 * - u0 and v0 are both read back before either is biased, and setPolyGT4
 *   follows the clut store.
 *
 * The GTE words come from the official Psy-Q inline_c.h macros; the profile
 * expands Psy-Q's RTPS placeholder to the real COP2 opcode. */
