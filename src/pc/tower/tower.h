/* Tower mode: a mod's "tower" key (notes/tower-mode.md).
 *
 * A tower is a run of duels, its floors, that the title's second menu
 * offers once a mod with a "tower" is on: each floor an opponent with a
 * field, a deck, starting LP and rules of its own (no fusions, no equips),
 * a reward, and lines of story before and after it, told as the campaign
 * tells its own (a scene, its large characters, its stone-framed box: the
 * stage below). Progress is the save's: it is
 * kept beside the memory card's block, as the card packs' is, and in every
 * save state.
 *
 * This header is in three parts: the tower as a mod writes it (read once at
 * startup, tower_config.c), the progress a save has in it and the rules it
 * follows (tower_config.c too, so the tests reach both without the game),
 * and what the game asks of it (tower.c, tower_screen.c). */
