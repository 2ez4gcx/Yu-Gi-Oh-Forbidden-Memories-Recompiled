"""Tower mode end to end, in the running game (notes/tower-mode.md).

Drives the game through tools/pc/yfm_control.py with the tests' tower mod
(tests/pc/tower/tower-test) and checks, by the game's own state, its log
(MEMORIES_TRACE=mods: the tower says each step it takes) and pictures:

  1. the title's second menu offers the tower's button; it is entered;
  2. floor 1 is won: its reward lands in the chest and the starchips, its
     checkpoint is saved through the game's own save (the port's slot menu);
  3. floor 2 (no fusions, the player at 100 LP) is lost: a fusion of the
     player's does not happen, the CPU's deck of fusion material never fuses,
     and the tower sends the player back to its checkpoint;
  4. a new process LOADs the save: the tower is at the checkpoint, floor 2;
  5. the tower-only duelist is not in Free Duel until floor 2 is won, and is
     after;
  6. floor 3 (no equips): the tower is cleared, the ending is told, the
     reward's duelist (Nitemare) joins the Free Duel grid;
  7. a control run without the rule: the same CPU deck fuses;
  8. "unlock": "after_ending": the button is dimmed and buzzes until the
     save has seen the ending.

Pictures of the game's frames go to --out. Exit status 0 when every check
holds.
