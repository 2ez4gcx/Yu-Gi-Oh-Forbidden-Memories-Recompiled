"""A duelist's bust: its large character, the one the campaign's dialogue
stands on its box, with named expressions that talk and blink
(notes/more-duelists.md, "bust"; src/pc/free_duel/busts.c).

A duelists entry writes it as

    "bust": {"default": "calm", "expressions": [
        {"name": "calm", "image": "busts/<id>/calm.png",
         "talk": ["busts/<id>/calm-talk1.png"], "blink": "busts/<id>/calm-blink.png"},
        ...]}

or "bust": "<a PNG>" (one expression, "default"). The editor keeps each
picture's bytes and the path it was read from; a picture made here goes in
busts/<id>/. "replace_bust": true on a disc duelist's ("replace") entry makes
it the campaign's character too (RosterDuelist.replace_bust).

The game draws an expression's talking and blink frames over its picture
where they differ from it, numbers the expressions 0 (the default) then in
the list's order, and changes four of one record in place; preview() shows a
picture where the game stands it, at the console's resolution.
