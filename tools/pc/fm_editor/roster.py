"""The duelists a mod adds past the disc's thirty-nine, and the disc's own it
takes over (notes/more-duelists.md; src/pc/free_duel/duelists.c).

A mod writes them as one file to a duelist:

    duelists/<id>.json      who it is: {"copy": "Simon Muran", "name": ...}
    decks/<id>.json         its deck pool, as a "decks" entry
    drops/<id>.json         its drop pools, as a "drops" entry
    portraits/<id>.png      its face

or as a "duelists" list in mod.json (each entry with its "id"), or as a file
that list is in. The editor reads all three and writes each duelist back
where it found it; a duelist made here goes in the folders.

A copy ("copy") is a duelist of its own: the editor keeps its four pools as
the game deals them (RosterDuelist.pools), starting from its base's, and
writes them as decks/<id>.json and drops/<id>.json against the base's disc
pools, which is what the game edits for it (tables.c Tables_PoolFor is handed
the base's disc pool). A replacement ("replace") takes over a disc duelist's
name, face and way of playing: its pools stay Project.pools[d], written in
mod.json's "decks" and "drops" by the disc's name as before, which still
reaches it.

A copy's fixed deck (decks/<id>.json with "fixed": true) is a
fixed_decks.FixedDeck in Project.fixed naming its entry, edited as a disc
duelist's is and written back to that file.

"unlock", "ai" and "ranks" stay in RosterDuelist.extra as written;
duelist_rules.py reads and edits them there. Anything else an entry carries
is kept as written too.

Where an added duelist lands on the Free Duel grid is worked out as
place_pending does for this mod alone: the entries that ask for a "slot"
first, in the order they are read (the manifest's list, then the folder's
files sorted by name), then everyone else at the lowest free place. Another
mod, or the player's own folder, can take a place first; the game settles
that, and its Mods window says so.
