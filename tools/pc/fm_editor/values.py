"""The game's numbers a mod may change (notes/gameplay-tables.md, "Values"):
the caps (ATK, DEF, LP, starchips...) and the other values the port reads in
place of the disc's (a Build Deck's copies, Swords of Revealing Light's
turns, the rank score, the starchips a win gives...). They are a mod's
"limits", as the port has always read them: src/pc/cards/tables.c
(read_limits, read_values). The checks here are that file's, so a problem
shows in the editor rather than as a line in the Mods window.

The mod.json shape:

        "stats": 30000, "attack": 30000, "defense": 30000,

The editor keeps it in Project.other["limits"] as written; the Values tab
turns it into a form (`flatten`) and back (`build`).
