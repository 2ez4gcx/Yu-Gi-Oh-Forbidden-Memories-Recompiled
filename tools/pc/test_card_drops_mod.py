"""Live test of a mod's lock on Game > Card drops (built game and user-supplied disc).

A mod's "limits": {"card_drops": n} makes every won duel deal n cards,
whatever the player set (notes/card-drops.md, "A mod that sets it"). This
wins test_card_drops.py's duel with mods in a test user directory and
counts the cards awarded on leaving RESULTS OF DUEL:

- a mod's 5 over the player's 99, and over MEMORIES_CARD_DROPS=99, deals 5;
- a mod's 99 over the player's 1 deals 99;
- the mod removed, the player's own 99 is dealt again;
- a mod's 0 is noted ("is at least 1; left out") and the player's count dealt;
- of two mods that lock it, the one applied later deals, and the earlier
  one is noted.

A state keeps the mods it was made with, so each case plays the duel's
opening with its own mods. The test also saves the window with Game open
(the locked row greyed and named after the mod, and the same menu without
the mod) as menu-locked.bmp and menu-player.bmp. Everything stays in
tmp/pc/card-drops-mod-smoke (or --out); no player saves are touched.
